<blockquote>
<p>Research data management concerns the organisation of data, from its entry to the research cycle through to the dissemination and archiving of valuable results.<br />
(Whyte, A., Tedds, J. (2011) <a href="https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/briefing-papers/making-case-rdm">"Making the Case for Research Data Management"</a>. DCC Briefing Papers)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="research-data">Research Data</h3>
<p>Research data is "The recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific/research community as necessary to validate research findings." (EPSRC)</p>
<p>Research data can exist in a variety formats (print, digital)  and types (statistics, experimental data, interview records)... essentially the building-blocks underpinning your work, study and research.</p>
<p>The University has a <a href="https://researchsupporthub.northampton.ac.uk/2014/11/20/research-data-management-principles-and-responsibilities/">Research Data Policy</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the recommendations of RCUK, the University expects researchers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposit the underlying data in our institutional repository, Pure, as a dataset.</li>
<li>Keep clear and accurate records of research procedures followed and results obtained.</li>
<li>Hold records securely in paper or electronic form.</li>
<li>Make relevant primary data and research evidence accessible for others (norm of 10 years) (through Pure and Arkivum).</li>
<li>Manage data according to research funder’s data policy, best ethical practice and adhering to all relevant legislation.</li>
<li>The University considers it to be good practice to deposit all research data where possible in Pure.</li>
<li>A persistent identifier (e.g., DOI), should be used to link any research outputs related to publications and projects.</li>
<li>Research articles that are derived from funded research must contain a data statement indicating both the location of any supporting research data and the level of "openness" to that data.</li>
<li>Some publishers now require that this information is contained in the article prior to accepting the article for publication (e.g., PLOS) – you should check the data sharing policy of any intended journal before you submit for an article for publication.</li>
<li>Data Journals – focus specifically on the dataset rather than the research article; the University of Edinburgh maintains a <a href="https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/datashare/Sources+of+dataset+peer+review">list of data journals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-a-data-management-plan">Creating a data management plan</h3>
<p>Reasons to create a data management plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comply with funder expectations.</li>
<li>Make data understandable and accessible, now and in the future.</li>
<li>Maximise data security.</li>
<li>Protect Intellectual Property.</li>
<li>Share and standardise good practice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-management-plan">Data management plan</h3>
<p>Prior to submitting your Research Proposal, or applying for funding, ensure that you have a robust data management plan in place.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this should be seen as a living document that can be updated and amended as required throughout the lifecycle of your research project.</p>
<p>You can create a Data Management Plan (DMP) using <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMP Online</a> (log in with your University login details).</p>

<h3 id="expectations-for-data-management">Expectations for data management</h3>
<ol>
<li>Published research papers should include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed (e.g., "The research data associated with this paper which was funded by EPSRC is available at: [URL or DOI]."</li>
<li>Publicly-funded research data that is not generated in digital format will be stored in a manner to facilitate it being shared in the event of a valid request for access to the data being received. This expectation could be satisfied by converting and storing such data in digital format in a timely manner (minimum of 10 years, or 10 years from the date of last access).</li>
<li>Appropriately structured metadata describing the research data is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet; in each case the metadata must be sufficient to allow others to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated, and how to access it. Where the research data referred to in the metadata is a digital object it is expected that the metadata will include use of a robust digital object identifier.</li>
<li>Where access to the data is restricted the published metadata should also give the reason and summarise the conditions which must be satisfied for access to be granted. For example ‘commercially confidential’ data, in which a business organisation has a legitimate interest, might be made available to others subject to a suitable legally enforceable non-disclosure agreement.</li>
<li>Research data is to be securely preserved for a minimum of 10 years from the date that any researcher "privileged access" period expires or, if others have accessed the data, from last date on which access to the data was requested by a third party; all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that publicly-funded data is not held in any jurisdiction where the available legal safeguards provide lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ethics-and-research-data-management">Ethics and Research Data Management</h2>
<h3 id="outline">Outline</h3>
<p>Most research data - even sensitive data - can be shared ethically and legally if researchers employ strategies of informed consent, anonymisation and controlling access to data. Researchers obtaining data from people are expected to maintain high ethical standards and comply with the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>Researchers must adhere to data protection requirements when managing or sharing personal data. However, not all research data obtained from people count as personal data. If data are anonymised then the Act will not apply as they no longer constitute 'personal data'. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides some exceptions for research data and applies only to personal or sensitive personal data, and not to all research data in general, nor to anonymised data. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation will come into effect in 2018 and will also play a key role in managing and sharing research data.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<p>The DPA defines 8 principles that deal with the processing of personal data relating to identifiable living people. All such data must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processed fairly and lawfully</li>
<li>Obtained and processed for a specified purpose</li>
<li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose</li>
<li>Accurate</li>
<li>Not kept longer than necessary</li>
<li>Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects, for example, the right to be informed about how data will be used, stored, processed, transferred, destroyed; and the right to access information and data held</li>
<li>Kept secure</li>
<li>Not transferred abroad without adequate protection</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definition-of-personal-data">Definition of personal data</h3>
<p>Personal data are records or other information that on its own, or linked with other data or information in the possession of the data controller, can reveal the identity of an actual living person.</p>
<h3 id="the-dpa-and-sharing-data">The DPA and sharing data</h3>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you really need to collect personal data? Often information such as participants' names and addresses are collected for administrative purposes only and have no research value. Not collecting personal data in the first place may make it easier to manage and share your data. Alternatively if they do need to be collected, for example, for follow-up interviews, they should be stored separately from research data</li>
<li>Inform your participants about use of personal data. All researchers must inform research participants about how any personal data collected about them will be used, stored, processed, transferred and destroyed. Personal data can only be disclosed if explicit consent has been given to do so, although there may be exceptions for legal reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definition-of-sensitive-personal-data">Definition of sensitive personal data</h3>
<p>Sensitive personal data are data on a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition, sexual life, commission or alleged commission of an offence, proceedings for an offence (alleged to have been) committed, disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="gdpr-and-personal-data">GDPR and personal data</h3>
<p>Like the DPA, the GDPR applies to 'personal data'. However, the GDPR's definition is more detailed and makes it clear that information such as an online identifier – e.g., an IP address – can be personal data. The more expansive definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.</p>
<p>The GDPR applies to both automated personal data and to manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria. This is wider than the DPA’s definition and could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data.</p>
<p>Personal data that has been pseudonymised – e.g., key-coded – can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-ethical-guidelines">Definition of Ethical Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
<li>Research should aim to maximise benefit for individuals and society and minimise risk and harm</li>
<li>The rights and dignity of individuals and groups should be respected wherever possible, participation should be voluntary and appropriately informed</li>
<li>Research should be conducted with integrity and transparency, lines of responsibility and accountability should be clearly defined</li>
<li>Independence of research should be maintained and where conflicts of interest cannot be avoided they should be made explicit.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="consent-for-data-sharing">Consent for data sharing</h4>
<ol>
<li>Informed consent is an ethical requirement for most research and must be considered and implemented throughout the research lifecycle, from planning to publication to sharing.</li>
<li>Failure to properly address issues of consent may restrict the opportunities for initial use of data, the publishing of your results and the sharing of the data.</li>
<li>In order to make sure that research data can be made available for future reuse, it is important that consent for future reuse of the data by other researchers is sought from participants. Participants should be informed how research data will be stored, preserved and used in the long-term, and how confidentiality can be protected when needed.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="language-to-avoid">Language to avoid</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consent forms should not preclude data sharing. So promises to destroy the data or promises that the data will only be seen or accessed by the research team should be avoided.</li>
<li>Terms such as 'fully anonymous' or 'strictly confidential' should be avoided, as they are often impossible to define. It would be better to indicate how data will be anonymised (e.g. by removing all personal information that could directly identify an individual) and that whilst data will be made available to other researchers, confidentiality will be protected.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-to-seek-consent-for-data-sharing">How to seek consent for data sharing</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consent procedures must be tailored for the specific research context, methods and sample, the nature of the data (personal, sensitive, level of detail), the format of the data (surveys, written, recordings) and the planned data uses and handling. This will influence the type of consent and consent process used.</li>
<li>It is important to note that researchers are not obliged to obtain consent. They are obliged to seek consent and to impartially advise participants about risks and benefits of research participation and data sharing. Participants then decide what they will consent to.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="datasets-and-data-access-statements">Datasets and Data Access Statements</h2>
<p>It is best practice, and often a requirement by both publishers and funders, that the underlying data to your research is made openly available for at least 10 years prior to the last time that it was accessed.</p>
<p>Datasets, like journal articles, can have embargo periods, restricting the access to the dataset for a period of time, the standard, accepted embargo period is 12 months. If you require the dataset to be embargoed further, you will need to provide evidence for the reason for this to the Head of Research Support. If you’re dataset needs to be restricted due to the nature of the data, e.g., human trafficking data, then the data can be restricted. All requirements by funders will be respected.</p>
<p>The University of Northampton will be able to provide you with a DOI for your dataset, after it has been uploaded and any required accompanying data provided. The datasets you register will appear on your Research Profile.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not digital preservation, but once the University has a suitable platform in place, this will allow us to transfer the dataset to that platform to enable digital preservation.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-a-data-access-statement">Purpose of a Data Access Statement</h3>
<p>A data access statement should direct the reader of a publication to underpinning data, or explain how underpinning data can be accessed. Researchers should include a data statement in their publications for the purposes of clarity and transparency and in accordance with the open data ethos advocated by RCUK and other research funders.</p>
<h3 id="components-of-a-data-access-statement">Components of a Data Access Statement</h3>
<p>Data statements should outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data that underpins a publication/research;</li>
<li>the source of the data (i.e. host repository and persistent link); and</li>
<li>any access/use conditions (e.g. access, subject to completion of a non-disclosure agreement).</li>
<li>If data is restricted, the reason for the restriction should be intimated.</li>
<li>If there is no data underpinning the paper, a statement confirming this should be provided to aid transparency.</li>
<li>A Digital object identifier should be included in the statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timing-and-locating-a-data-access-statement">Timing and locating a Data Access Statement</h3>
<p>Data statements need to be prepared prior to final submission of publication. Researchers need to deposit their dataset in Pure and upon receipt of the dataset Digital object identifier they should draft their statement and include this in the most appropriate area of the publication.</p>
<p>Data statements are often located within the Acknowledgments section or Reference lists of papers however, this will vary, as it is dependent upon the publisher's editorial processes. Researchers should check the journal's data policy or contact <a href="mailto:pure@northampton.ac.uk">pure@northampton.ac.uk</a> for advice.</p>
<h3 id="sample-data-access-statements">Sample Data Access Statements</h3>
<p>The list below provides some example data statements. Please note that data access statements should be tailored to suit each publication, checking that they meet all funder and publisher requirements.</p>

<h4 id="publication-date">Publication date</h4>
<p>If your dataset has already been published, give the date here. Otherwise, input the current year.</p>
<h4 id="access-contact-details">Access contact details</h4>
<p>This is the main contact person for the dataset and must be one of the people listed as a ‘Creator’ in the ‘People’ section. If this is left blank we will assume that the first named ‘Creator’ of the project is the main contact.</p>
<h4 id="temporal-coverage">Temporal coverage</h4>
<p>If your dataset relates to period of time before you collected it (for example, animal records from 1850-1905), enter the date range here.</p>
<h4 id="geographical-location">Geographical location</h4>
<p>The information in this section enables your dataset to be found in searches for data about a particular area/place. Leave this section blank if your dataset contains information about vulnerable groups  (for example,  endangered species) or if location is not relevant.</p>
<h4 id="geographical-coverage">Geographical coverage</h4>
<p>Use this field to describe the location of data in words (e.g. Northampton, UK).</p>
<h4 id="geospatial-point-and-area">Geospatial point and Area</h4>
<p>If it is appropriate and if the data were collected at a specific point, select ‘Point’ and enter the latitude and longitude separated by a comma, do the same for area.</p>
<h4 id="legalethical">Legal/ethical</h4>
<p>In this section you must tell us about any data protection, ethical, commercial or sensitivity issues that relate to your dataset. If you are unsure email <a href="mailto:pure@northampton.ac.uk">pure@northampton.ac.uk</a> with the subject Datasets – Ethics for advice before saving your item for validation. (Save dataset as entry in progress until matter resolved).</p>
<h4 id="data-protection">Data protection</h4>
<p>Tick this box if your dataset contains personal data unless the data has been fully anonymised.</p>
<p>Provide details about whether you have gained consent from participants for data sharing, and if so under what terms (for example, data anonymisation or data sharing agreements).</p>
<h4 id="ethical-approval">Ethical approval</h4>
<p>Tick this box if your research required ethical approval.</p>
<p>Provide details on whether this affects your ability to share the data.</p>
<h4 id="commercial-constraints">Commercial constraints</h4>
<p>Tick this box if commercial considerations constrain your ability to share the data.</p>
<p>In the text box that appears provide further details of these constraints (e.g. embargo time to allow commercialisation). If you have been working with a commercial partner, the constraints should be clear from the collaboration agreements.</p>
<p>Consult with RIFS (Research Information &amp; Funding Services) for more information.</p>
<h4 id="sensitive">Sensitive</h4>
<p>Tick this box if your dataset contains material which may be considered to be sensitive for any reason not already covered (for example, locations of endangered species, fragile ecosystems, genetically-modified crops or animal testing units or data subject to non-disclosure agreements).</p>
<p>Provide details of the nature of this sensitivity and the restrictions that should be put in place for the dataset or dataset record.</p>
<h4 id="relations-to-other-content">Relations to other content</h4>
<p>Use the <strong>Project</strong> button to link your dataset to a project. We need to know this in order to tell who funded the work.</p>
<p>You can also link your dataset to other outputs: - publications (articles, chapters) that make use of the data - related datasets (for example, from the same project or programme of work)</p>
<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
<p>This section determines whether the dataset will appear on your Research Profile. Set it to <strong>Campus</strong> to begin with. We will change it to <strong>Public</strong> for you later.</p>
<p>If you have indicated in the <strong>Legal/ethical</strong> section that the dataset is so sensitive that even the record describing it cannot be made public change this setting to ‘Confidential – restricted to associated users and editors’. This will mean that the record will remain in Pure but will not be publicly accessible.</p>
<h3 id="does-data-have-to-be-open-access">Does data have to be Open Access?</h3>
<p>In most cases the default setting for deposited data is open access. However, there are circumstances where access to data can be restricted either permanently or for a limited embargo period.</p>
<p>Common circumstances for restriction include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Protection</li>
<li>Ethical approval</li>
<li>Commercial constraints</li>
<li>Sensitive content</li>
<li>Moratorium on thesis data</li>
<li>Period of exclusivity for data creators</li>
</ul>
<p>Pure offers a range of data visibility and access options to support your data and research requirements, email the Research Support Team at <a href="mailto:pure@northampton.ac.uk">pure@northampton.ac.uk</a> for further advice.</p>
<h3 id="external-data-deposit">External data deposit</h3>
<p>Research data produced at the University of Northampton should be deposited in PURE unless circumstances determine that a more appropriate repository is chosen, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funder of the research mandate a specific data repository</li>
<li>In joint research projects the data is deposited in the repository of a collaborator</li>
<li>A specialist or disciplinary focused repository exists that provides data with greater impact</li>
<li>Certain types of data, typically software or code, are better served in a version control repository such as GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only local requirement for external deposit is that a corresponding dataset record must be created in Pure which references and links to the external repository.</p>
<p>If you are uncertain where to deposit your dataset/s please contact the Research Support Team at <a href="mailto:pure@northampton.ac.uk">pure@northampton.ac.uk</a> with the subject Datasets.</p>
