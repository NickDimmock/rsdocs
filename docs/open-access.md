# Open Access

## What is Open Access?

Open Access is unrestricted access via the internet to peer reviewed scholarly research.

Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, made available through the internet, including for those who do not have access to personal or institutional subscriptions to journals, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.

This includes:

- Journal articles
- Conference proceedings
- Books &amp; book chapters
- Monographs
- Research data
- Educational resources

An advantage of OA over traditional publishing models is a higher impact and visibility of research, since that research reaches a wider audience. Research that is open access can therefore result in increased collaboration opportunities and citation impact.

The following videos that explain this further:

## Open Access funding

### University of Northampton funding

The University of Northampton has a small institutional fund for the payment of article processing charge.  These must be agreed in advance of payment with the Head of Research Support, in addition the following conditions must be met:

- No suitable "green" route to open access (open access achieved through the accepted manuscript being deposited in Pure)
- Principle author must be staff member or post graduate student currently employed by the University of Northampton
- Article must be published under a CC-BY licence
- Accepted manuscript must be deposited in Pure
- Underlying dataset must be deposited in Pure

Note – payment for monographs will also be considered

Publishing "gold" allows the published version of your output to be made freely available immediately upon publication to anyone with internet access, rather than the accepted manuscript – which is often embargoed for a set time (generally between 6 – 24 months).

The University has entered into agreements that allow us discounts or for the cost to be part of our journal subscription cost for article processing charges:

- Springer (Most APC's zero cost – check with Research Support if in doubt
- Wylie (All APC's zero cost)
- SAGE (£200 Discount)
- Taylor and Francis (75% discount on most journals – must use NESLI voucher code)

When publishing with any publisher, please contact [openaccess@northampton.ac.uk](mailto:openaccess@northampton.ac.uk) and we can guide you through the copyright transfer process.

### Research funders

Most research funders have a requirement for outputs that are published as a result of the funding, are made open access.  Additionally many funders also require the underlying data to also be made available By accepting a research grant, the grant holder is responsible for meeting these requirements.

If you do not comply with the funder's policy, the existing grant may be partially withheld, and you may not be eligible for future funding from this funder.

## Open Access and PhD theses

It is a University requirement for all doctoral theses to be submitted electronically to [the University's repository Pure.](http://pure.northampton.ac.uk/) The full text of the thesis will then be made available open access via Pure and the [British Library's EthOS repository.](http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do) Open access is also a requirement of many funders.

Making your thesis available open access has a number of advantages:

- Your thesis is directly discoverable by search engines, increasing the chance of citation and subsequent collaboration based upon the work
- Pure gives your thesis a stable URL, allowing you to monitor its impact by tracking citations and downloads, as well as protecting your work against plagiarism.

In certain circumstances, for example where there are commercial or political sensitivities, students may embargo their thesis for an approved period. This should be discussed with your supervisor in the first instance.

There has been concern in the past that open access to theses may be regarded as "prior publication" and prevent future development into a monograph. As a thesis would generally require significant revision before being published as a monograph, many publishers do not require the thesis to be embargoed. However, if you intend to develop your thesis into a monograph, you should contact potential publishers **before** making a decision about embargoes, as publisher policies vary considerably. You can carry out a quick [check on what publishers do and don’t allow in relation to publishing from your thesis.](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VrXFJe_df0svkIvVBgFngrDPjDIsfzJSqFXzyX2lzWc/edit?fbclid=IwAR2JaUzTKB8OI-guesW57L-plaBOYYzaKlGa-Mefxps5TAjvqCelpktPlio#gid=768788756)

## Open Access resources

### Finding Open Access material

- [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/) (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine) – Provides more than 120 million documents from more than 6,000 sources. You can access the full texts of about 60% of the indexed documents for free (Open Access).
- [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) (COnecting REpositories) – An aggregation of open access content from UK and worldwide repositories and open access journals. It provides a range of services including discovery, analytics, and text mining access.
- [Directory of Open Access Books](http://www.doabooks.org/) (DOAB) – academic open access books from hundreds of publishers.
- [Directory of Open Access Journals](http://www.doaj.org/) (DOAJ) – global list of fully OA journals.
- [Registry of Open Access Repositories](http://roar.eprints.org/) (ROAR) – A searchable international database indexing the creation, location and growth of open access institutional repositories and their contents.

### Browser tools

There are several browser tools to help you find Open Access options for paywalled outputs:

- [CORE Discovery](https://core.ac.uk/services/discovery) – An in-browser extension from CORE (see above) – also recommends OA articles on a similar subject if the article is paywalled.
- [Kopernio](https://kopernio.com/) – Provides a "get PDF" button in your browser.
- [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) – Automatically detects paywalled articles and presents an open access alternative (for example a version in an institutional repository)
- [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) – An extension which searches Unpaywall’s database of millions of free scholarly articles each time you encounter a paywall.

#### Creative Commons and funders

##### UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)

UKRI prefer outputs to be made available under open licences that facilitate reuse (such as CC BY), and CC-BY-NC-ND licences are strongly recommended but not mandatory.

##### Research Councils UK (RCUK)

Where Research Council funds are used to pay the APC for an Open Access paper; they require that the publisher makes the paper freely available under the CC BY licence. Where the ‘Green route’ to Open Access is used, any of the above licence types may be used.

##### Wellcome Trust

Where Wellcome Trust funds are used to pay for Open Access (Gold route); the CC BY licence must be used for research articles. For books and monographs, the CC BY licence is encouraged, but all of the above licences are acceptable. If the ‘Green’ route is used any of the above licences may be used.
