# Research Excellence Framework (REF)

## What is the REF's purpose?

The funding bodies' shared policy aim for research assessment is to secure the continuation of a world-class, dynamic and responsive research base across the full academic spectrum within UK higher education. We expect that this will be achieved through the threefold purpose of the REF:

- To provide accountability for public investment in research and produce evidence of the benefits of this investment.
- To provide benchmarking information and establish reputational yardsticks, for use within the HE sector and for public information.
- To inform the selective allocation of funding for research.

## How is the REF carried out?

[The REF is a process of expert review](https://www.ref.ac.uk/panels/what-is-the-role-of-expert-panels/), carried out by expert panels for each of the [34 subject based units of assessment (UOAs)](https://www.ref.ac.uk/panels/units-of-assessment/), under the guidance of four main panels. Expert panels are made up of senior academics, international members, and [research users](https://www.ref.ac.uk/about/guide-for-research-users/).

For each submission, three distinct elements are assessed: the quality of outputs (e.g. publications, performances, and exhibitions), their impact beyond academia, and the environment that supports research.

In order for an Institution to submit to the REF, each Institution is required to write and have approved a code of practice that sets out their approaches to ensuring equality and transparency in REF 2021 decision-making processes, specifically in relation to:

- the determination of staff that have a significant responsibility for research & are independent researchers
- the process by which research outputs will be selected for inclusion in the REF, taking into account individual circumstances in a fair and transparent manner.

The University of Northampton's code of practice REF2021​ has now been approved by Research England, and is now available for all staff.

## Open Access and the REF

### REF 2020-2021

The REF 2021 publication period closed on 31 December 2020, and the next REF publication cycle began on 1 January 2021.

Researchers should continue to comply with the requirements of the REF 2021 Open Access (OA) policy.

Research England will launch a consultation on the future REF OA policy following the outcome of the [UKRI OA review](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/open-access-policies-review/). The Research England [Open Research page](https://re.ukri.org/research/open-access-research/) includes the following statement:

> The UK HE funding bodies recognise that due notice will be needed prior to implementation of the OA policy for the next REF, which will be consulted on after UKRI's OA policy is announced… **The REF 2021 OA policy should be followed until further notice**.

[The REF 2021 Open Access policy](http://www.ref.ac.uk/publications/2018/draftguidanceonsubmissions201801.html) applies from 1 April 2016 to:

- Articles published in scholarly journals with an ISSN.
- Full length conference papers published with an ISSN.

Note – this does not apply to chapters, monographs, abstracts, posters or presentations – but these should also have full-text uploaded to Pure on publication (where these can be made available they will, all publisher policies will be respected).

These research outputs must be deposited within three months of acceptance or they will be ineligible for submission to the REF.

### Exceptions

Exceptions are available for research outputs that cannot meet the deposit, access or technical requirements of the policy, however, most research outputs will not qualify for exceptions to the policy.

If a research output is not deposited within three months of acceptance and it does not qualify for an exception, then the output will not be eligible for submission in REF 2021. One output or up to 5% of outputs in scope within a unit of assessment may be submitted to the REF if they are non-compliant.

### Five simple steps to REF OA compliance

#### 1 : Prior to publishing

- Check if the journal is compliant and reputable.
- Does journal allow deposit of accepted manuscript in institutional repository – within 12 months from publication for Panels A & B, or 24 months for Panels C & D.
- If not – or unsure – email [openaccess@northampton.ac.uk](mailto:openaccess@northampton.ac.uk).

#### 2: Create a publication record

- [Log into Pure](https://pure.northampton.ac.uk/)
- Select the **Add Content** button and select the appropriate output type
- Complete all compulsory fields
- Complete **Add publication status and date** = submitted or in preparation
- Save record as **Entry in progress**

#### 3: When output is accepted for publication

- Complete "Add publication status and date..." – Accepted/Inpress – enter full date dd/mm/yyyy
- Upload the Accepted Manuscript (Add electronic version (file, DOI, or link))
- Select Document Version of Accepted Author Manuscript
- Select access as unknown, click on create
- Add as much information as possible
- Mark record "for validation"
- Don’t forget to save the record!

#### 4: Once output has been published

- Update publication status - **Add publication status and date** published, or epbub ahead of print – enter full date dd/mm/yyyy
- Add as much information as possible – e.g., keywords
- Set record for **Revalidation**

#### 5: Once output has been validated

- Research Support staff will check copyright and metadata and validate the record.
- Once validated – the output will be included the public pure portal.
- Let people know! Use the links from Pure to tweet, blog, and share your research!
