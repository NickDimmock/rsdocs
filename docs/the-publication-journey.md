# The publication journey

## Before you publish

### Things to consider when looking for a publisher

- [SciVal](http://www.scival.com) - Use SciVal to check where other academics are publishing in your subject area, and what journals are in the top percentiles for citations and prominence.
- [Think-Check-Submit](http://thinkchecksubmit.org/) - There are many predatory journals, promising quick turn arounds of peer-review, high impact factors and indexed by all sorts of companies.  Use the tool "Think-Check-Submit" for guidance on issues to consider.
- [Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org/) - If the journal is open access, is it listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)? (quality check)
- [Open Access Scholarly Publishers’ Association (OASPA)](http://oaspa.org/) - If the journal is Open Access, does the publisher belong to the Open Access Scholarly Publishers’ Association (OASPA)? (quality check)

#### Warning signs

Look out for the following warning signs:

- Board of Editors list shows that members are not recognised in their field or that they are affiliated with questionable institutions; however, this should be done with caution, as Board member names may be used without their permission.
- Journals with dubious or non-existent addresses for their registered office.
- Unsolicited email or paper communication inviting publication in journals you don’t know or have never heard of.
- Unsolicited invitations to conferences run by event managers, not professionals in the research area, often at attractive destinations.
- Note – Legitimate new journals acknowledge if they are newly created and do not yet have an impact factor.
- Reputable journals typically will be listed in Journal Citation Reports.
- Resist the temptation to publish quickly and easily in any journal. Be aware of the publication landscape in your research area and the most reputable journals.

### Choosing a publisher

It is important to choose which journal you publish in carefully to maximize dissemination, visibility and citations to your research.
