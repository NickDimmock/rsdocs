                <h1 id="author-affiliation-acknowledgements">Author affiliation &amp; acknowledgements</h1>
<p>University of Northampton researchers are expected to disseminate their research and publish in the best possible places. In doing so, they need to ensure their affiliation is correctly listed and that appropriate acknowledgement is given for any support provided in undertaking that research.</p>
<p>The University expects anyone listed as an author on a paper to accept personal responsibility for ensuring that they are familiar with the contents of the paper; be able to defend the research outlined in the paper; and be able to identify their contribution.</p>
<p>Authors are expected to state their affiliation to the University of Northampton.  This should be done by subject area / research centre / institute followed by University of Northampton.  University of Northampton must be in full not UON.  Only substantive and honorary members of staff and students of the University can affiliate themselves to the University e.g., <strong>Research Centre of Excellence; University of Northampton</strong>.</p>
<p>An author of a manuscript should have made a significant contribution to the manuscript and shares responsibility and accountability for the results reported. Lesser contributions by others should be listed in the acknowledgment, if applicable. An administrative relationship to a study or a relationship as supervisor or being responsible for the funding does not necessarily qualify a person for authorship. The submitting author should, at all times, send all co-authors the final draft of the manuscript and receive their approval before submission and publication of the work.</p>
<p>Most journals require the contribution(s) of each author to be stated in the manuscript, e.g. the <a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">CRediT – Contribute Roles Taxonomy</a> used by Elsevier is now used by more than 1000 of their journals to identify contributor roles to scholarly output . Journals may also require an author to provide an <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID ID</a>. The ORCID ID is a unique identifier that distinguishes you and your work from other researchers and their work.</p>
<p>Guidelines for authorship vary among disciplines. In general, authorship implies that a person has made a substantial contribution to, at least, two of the following research activities of a manuscript:</p>
<ul>
<li>initiation and design of the research</li>
<li>data collection</li>
<li>data analysis</li>
<li>writing of the manuscript</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="order-of-the-authors">Order of the authors</h2>
<p>For many disciplines, the first author is the person who has made the most important contribution. Co-authors can be ranked in order of decreasing importance of their contribution or in alphabetical order if their contributions were equal. The second or last author may be the second most important contributor, the direct supervisor or the research leader, depending on the discipline. Note that all supervisors and research leaders mentioned as co-author should have made a substantial contribution to the manuscript in at least two of the above-mentioned activities.</p>
<p>It is recommended, based on expected research activities, to agree early in the research process on criteria and tasks for first authorship and the order of co-authors. Contributors should collectively decide on authorship and the order in which authors appear on the manuscript. Clarify any issue or conflict regarding authorship before submitting a manuscript to a journal or a publisher. Adding or removing authors and changing the order of authors is often very difficult once a manuscript has been accepted for publication.</p>
<p>Authors can only use an affiliation in a manuscript when a significant contribution has been made from work associated with that affiliation. An author may be justified to use double affiliations for a manuscript. However, it is unethical to list affiliations from which no significant scientific contribution to the manuscript has been made, even in case a formal relationship exists or existed with that affiliation. Most confusion arises in those cases where an author, besides her/his UON affiliation, also has a formal work-related relationship with an institute outside UON. In this case, the following guidelines apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publications in the context of a UON PhD project will always be considered as a UON output. In case a PhD candidate has a (part-time) formal association with an institute outside UON, it is justified to also specify this affiliation within a publication if the PhD project is based on this formal association.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note - Your affiliation in the manuscript should <strong>be the institution where you conducted the research</strong>. You should also include details of any funding received. If you have changed affiliation since completing the research, your new affiliation can be acknowledged in a note.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Those who might fall under consideration for requiring acknowledgement could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students</li>
<li>Research assistants</li>
<li>technical officers</li>
<li>individuals and organisations which have provided data or other forms of support which contributed to the research findings being reported, in line with any disciplinary norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledgement should be careful not to imply endorsement by acknowledged parties, and the University would advise that the corresponding author should obtain permission to be acknowledged from all acknowledged parties.</p>
<p>If the research has been funded, then this must be acknowledged including the grant number – e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number zzzz]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Grant number format must exactly match that used by the funder, including the correct punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-statement">Data statement</h2>
<p>A data access statement should direct the reader of a publication to underpinning data, or explain how underpinning data can be accessed. Researchers should include a data statement in their publications for the purposes of clarity and transparency and in accordance with the open data ethos advocated by RCUK and other research funders.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All data underpinning this publication are openly available from the University of Northampton Research Explorer at https://doi.org/10.15000/a789457</p>
</blockquote>
