In doing so, they need to ensure their affiliation is correctly listed and that appropriate acknowledgement is given for any support provided in undertaking that research. The University expects anyone listed as an author on a paper to accept personal responsibility for ensuring that they are familiar with the contents of the paper; be able to defend the research outlined in the paper; and be able to identify their contribution. Authors are expected to state their affiliation to the University of Northampton. This should be done by subject area / research centre / institute followed by University of Northampton. University of Northampton must be in full not UON. Only substantive and honorary members of staff and students of the University can affiliate themselves to the University e.g., Research Centre of Excellence; University of Northampton . An author of a manuscript should have made a significant contribution to the manuscript and shares responsibility and accountability for the results reported. Lesser contributions by others should be listed in the acknowledgment, if applicable. An administrative relationship to a study or a relationship as supervisor or being responsible for the funding does not necessarily qualify a person for authorship. The submitting author should, at all times, send all co-authors the final draft of the manuscript and receive their approval before submission and publication of the work. Most journals require the contribution(s) of each author to be stated in the manuscript, e.g. the CRediT \u2013 Contribute Roles Taxonomy used by Elsevier is now used by more than 1000 of their journals to identify contributor roles to scholarly output . Journals may also require an author to provide an ORCID ID . The ORCID ID is a unique identifier that distinguishes you and your work from other researchers and their work. Guidelines for authorship vary among disciplines. In general, authorship implies that a person has made a substantial contribution to, at least, two of the following research activities of a manuscript: initiation and design of the research data collection data analysis writing of the manuscript Order of the authors For many disciplines, the first author is the person who has made the most important contribution. Co-authors can be ranked in order of decreasing importance of their contribution or in alphabetical order if their contributions were equal. The second or last author may be the second most important contributor, the direct supervisor or the research leader, depending on the discipline. Note that all supervisors and research leaders mentioned as co-author should have made a substantial contribution to the manuscript in at least two of the above-mentioned activities. It is recommended, based on expected research activities, to agree early in the research process on criteria and tasks for first authorship and the order of co-authors. Contributors should collectively decide on authorship and the order in which authors appear on the manuscript. Clarify any issue or conflict regarding authorship before submitting a manuscript to a journal or a publisher. Adding or removing authors and changing the order of authors is often very difficult once a manuscript has been accepted for publication. Authors can only use an affiliation in a manuscript when a significant contribution has been made from work associated with that affiliation. An author may be justified to use double affiliations for a manuscript. However, it is unethical to list affiliations from which no significant scientific contribution to the manuscript has been made, even in case a formal relationship exists or existed with that affiliation. Most confusion arises in those cases where an author, besides her/his UON affiliation, also has a formal work-related relationship with an institute outside UON. In this case, the following guidelines apply: Publications in the context of a UON PhD project will always be considered as a UON output. In case a PhD candidate has a (part-time) formal association with an institute outside UON, it is justified to also specify this affiliation within a publication if the PhD project is based on this formal association. Note - Your affiliation in the manuscript should be the institution where you conducted the research . You should also include details of any funding received. If you have changed affiliation since completing the research, your new affiliation can be acknowledged in a note. Acknowledgements Those who might fall under consideration for requiring acknowledgement could include: Students Research assistants technical officers individuals and organisations which have provided data or other forms of support which contributed to the research findings being reported, in line with any disciplinary norms. Acknowledgement should be careful not to imply endorsement by acknowledged parties, and the University would advise that the corresponding author should obtain permission to be acknowledged from all acknowledged parties. If the research has been funded, then this must be acknowledged including the grant number \u2013 e.g.: This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number zzzz] Grant number format must exactly match that used by the funder, including the correct punctuation. Data statement A data access statement should direct the reader of a publication to underpinning data, or explain how underpinning data can be accessed. Researchers should include a data statement in their publications for the purposes of clarity and transparency and in accordance with the open data ethos advocated by RCUK and other research funders.

(Whyte, A., Tedds, J. (2011) \"Making the Case for Research Data Management\" . DCC Briefing Papers) Research Data Research data is \"The recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific/research community as necessary to validate research findings.\" (EPSRC) Research data can exist in a variety formats (print, digital) and types (statistics, experimental data, interview records)... essentially the building-blocks underpinning your work, study and research. The University has a Research Data Policy . In accordance with the recommendations of RCUK, the University expects researchers to: Deposit the underlying data in our institutional repository, Pure, as a dataset. Keep clear and accurate records of research procedures followed and results obtained. Hold records securely in paper or electronic form. Make relevant primary data and research evidence accessible for others (norm of 10 years) (through Pure and Arkivum). Manage data according to research funder\u2019s data policy, best ethical practice and adhering to all relevant legislation. The University considers it to be good practice to deposit all research data where possible in Pure. A persistent identifier (e.g., DOI), should be used to link any research outputs related to publications and projects. Research articles that are derived from funded research must contain a data statement indicating both the location of any supporting research data and the level of \"openness\" to that data. Some publishers now require that this information is contained in the article prior to accepting the article for publication (e.g., PLOS) \u2013 you should check the data sharing policy of any intended journal before you submit for an article for publication. Data Journals \u2013 focus specifically on the dataset rather than the research article; the University of Edinburgh maintains a list of data journals . Creating a data management plan Reasons to create a data management plan: Comply with funder expectations. Make data understandable and accessible, now and in the future. Maximise data security. Protect Intellectual Property. Share and standardise good practice. Data management plan Prior to submitting your Research Proposal, or applying for funding, ensure that you have a robust data management plan in place. It is worth noting that this should be seen as a living document that can be updated and amended as required throughout the lifecycle of your research project. You can create a Data Management Plan (DMP) using DMP Online (log in with your University login details). Essentials for a Data Management Plan All data management plans should address the following as a minimum: Admin Details Plan Name Plan ID Principal Investigator / Researcher Plan Data Contact Plan Description Institution ORCID details Making a Data Management Plan Log into DMP Online using your University login details Check your funder\u2019s research data policy; some funders have specific templates The University of Northampton has a template created for non-funded research Data Collection What data will you collect or create? How will the data be collected or created? Documentation and Metadata What documentation and metadata will accompany the data? Ethics and Legal Compliance How will you manage any ethical issues? How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues? Storage and Backup How will the data be stored and backed up during the research? How will you manage access and security? Selection and Preservation Which data are of long-term value and should be retained, shared, and/or preserved? What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset? Data Sharing How will you share the data? Are any restrictions on data sharing required? Responsibilities and Resources Who will be responsible for data management? What resources will you require to deliver your plan? Sources and contact If you require further information please email Dawn Hibbert ( dawn.hibbert@northampton.ac.uk ). Information obtained and adapted from UK Data Service and Information Commissioners Office . Expectations for data management Published research papers should include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed (e.g., \"The research data associated with this paper which was funded by EPSRC is available at: [URL or DOI].\" Publicly-funded research data that is not generated in digital format will be stored in a manner to facilitate it being shared in the event of a valid request for access to the data being received. This expectation could be satisfied by converting and storing such data in digital format in a timely manner (minimum of 10 years, or 10 years from the date of last access). Appropriately structured metadata describing the research data is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet; in each case the metadata must be sufficient to allow others to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated, and how to access it. Where the research data referred to in the metadata is a digital object it is expected that the metadata will include use of a robust digital object identifier. Where access to the data is restricted the published metadata should also give the reason and summarise the conditions which must be satisfied for access to be granted. For example \u2018commercially confidential\u2019 data, in which a business organisation has a legitimate interest, might be made available to others subject to a suitable legally enforceable non-disclosure agreement. Research data is to be securely preserved for a minimum of 10 years from the date that any researcher \"privileged access\" period expires or, if others have accessed the data, from last date on which access to the data was requested by a third party; all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that publicly-funded data is not held in any jurisdiction where the available legal safeguards provide lower levels of protection than are available in the UK. Ethics and Research Data Management Outline Most research data - even sensitive data - can be shared ethically and legally if researchers employ strategies of informed consent, anonymisation and controlling access to data. Researchers obtaining data from people are expected to maintain high ethical standards and comply with the relevant legislation. Researchers must adhere to data protection requirements when managing or sharing personal data. However, not all research data obtained from people count as personal data. If data are anonymised then the Act will not apply as they no longer constitute 'personal data'. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides some exceptions for research data and applies only to personal or sensitive personal data, and not to all research data in general, nor to anonymised data. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation will come into effect in 2018 and will also play a key role in managing and sharing research data. Principles The DPA defines 8 principles that deal with the processing of personal data relating to identifiable living people. All such data must be: Processed fairly and lawfully Obtained and processed for a specified purpose Adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose Accurate Not kept longer than necessary Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects, for example, the right to be informed about how data will be used, stored, processed, transferred, destroyed; and the right to access information and data held Kept secure Not transferred abroad without adequate protection Definition of personal data Personal data are records or other information that on its own, or linked with other data or information in the possession of the data controller, can reveal the identity of an actual living person. The DPA and sharing data Consider: Do you really need to collect personal data? Often information such as participants' names and addresses are collected for administrative purposes only and have no research value. Not collecting personal data in the first place may make it easier to manage and share your data. Alternatively if they do need to be collected, for example, for follow-up interviews, they should be stored separately from research data Inform your participants about use of personal data. All researchers must inform research participants about how any personal data collected about them will be used, stored, processed, transferred and destroyed. Personal data can only be disclosed if explicit consent has been given to do so, although there may be exceptions for legal reasons. Definition of sensitive personal data Sensitive personal data are data on a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition, sexual life, commission or alleged commission of an offence, proceedings for an offence (alleged to have been) committed, disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. GDPR and personal data Like the DPA, the GDPR applies to 'personal data'. However, the GDPR's definition is more detailed and makes it clear that information such as an online identifier \u2013 e.g., an IP address \u2013 can be personal data. The more expansive definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people. The GDPR applies to both automated personal data and to manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria. This is wider than the DPA\u2019s definition and could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data. Personal data that has been pseudonymised \u2013 e.g., key-coded \u2013 can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual. Definition of Ethical Guidelines Research should aim to maximise benefit for individuals and society and minimise risk and harm The rights and dignity of individuals and groups should be respected wherever possible, participation should be voluntary and appropriately informed Research should be conducted with integrity and transparency, lines of responsibility and accountability should be clearly defined Independence of research should be maintained and where conflicts of interest cannot be avoided they should be made explicit. Consent for data sharing Informed consent is an ethical requirement for most research and must be considered and implemented throughout the research lifecycle, from planning to publication to sharing. Failure to properly address issues of consent may restrict the opportunities for initial use of data, the publishing of your results and the sharing of the data. In order to make sure that research data can be made available for future reuse, it is important that consent for future reuse of the data by other researchers is sought from participants. Participants should be informed how research data will be stored, preserved and used in the long-term, and how confidentiality can be protected when needed. Language to avoid Consent forms should not preclude data sharing. So promises to destroy the data or promises that the data will only be seen or accessed by the research team should be avoided. Terms such as 'fully anonymous' or 'strictly confidential' should be avoided, as they are often impossible to define. It would be better to indicate how data will be anonymised (e.g. by removing all personal information that could directly identify an individual) and that whilst data will be made available to other researchers, confidentiality will be protected. How to seek consent for data sharing Consent procedures must be tailored for the specific research context, methods and sample, the nature of the data (personal, sensitive, level of detail), the format of the data (surveys, written, recordings) and the planned data uses and handling. This will influence the type of consent and consent process used. It is important to note that researchers are not obliged to obtain consent. They are obliged to seek consent and to impartially advise participants about risks and benefits of research participation and data sharing. Participants then decide what they will consent to. Datasets and Data Access Statements It is best practice, and often a requirement by both publishers and funders, that the underlying data to your research is made openly available for at least 10 years prior to the last time that it was accessed. Datasets, like journal articles, can have embargo periods, restricting the access to the dataset for a period of time, the standard, accepted embargo period is 12 months. If you require the dataset to be embargoed further, you will need to provide evidence for the reason for this to the Head of Research Support. If you\u2019re dataset needs to be restricted due to the nature of the data, e.g., human trafficking data, then the data can be restricted. All requirements by funders will be respected. The University of Northampton will be able to provide you with a DOI for your dataset, after it has been uploaded and any required accompanying data provided. The datasets you register will appear on your Research Profile. Please note that this is not digital preservation, but once the University has a suitable platform in place, this will allow us to transfer the dataset to that platform to enable digital preservation. Purpose of a Data Access Statement A data access statement should direct the reader of a publication to underpinning data, or explain how underpinning data can be accessed. Researchers should include a data statement in their publications for the purposes of clarity and transparency and in accordance with the open data ethos advocated by RCUK and other research funders. Components of a Data Access Statement Data statements should outline: the data that underpins a publication/research; the source of the data (i.e. host repository and persistent link); and any access/use conditions (e.g. access, subject to completion of a non-disclosure agreement). If data is restricted, the reason for the restriction should be intimated. If there is no data underpinning the paper, a statement confirming this should be provided to aid transparency. A Digital object identifier should be included in the statement. Timing and locating a Data Access Statement Data statements need to be prepared prior to final submission of publication. Researchers need to deposit their dataset in Pure and upon receipt of the dataset Digital object identifier they should draft their statement and include this in the most appropriate area of the publication. Data statements are often located within the Acknowledgments section or Reference lists of papers however, this will vary, as it is dependent upon the publisher's editorial processes. Researchers should check the journal's data policy or contact pure@northampton.ac.uk for advice. Sample Data Access Statements The list below provides some example data statements. Please note that data access statements should be tailored to suit each publication, checking that they meet all funder and publisher requirements.

The record and data will then be made available in the Data Sets section of the Pure portal, subject to any applied embargo or access restrictions If you need additional support please email pure@northampton.ac.uk with the subject \"Datasets\". Guidance on completing metadata fields Details This section collects basic information about the dataset. The information you provide here will help you and others find the record again in Pure and other systems. Title Provide a name for your dataset that would make sense to someone searching for data, for example 'Dataset for [journal article name]' Description Describe your dataset so another researcher could decide if it was relevant to their research. Note, you will have an opportunity to provide a lay summary and detailed documentation when you edit the public facing record, so you do not have to provide them here. Collection date(s) Provide the start and end date of your period of data collection or of your study period. People This section collects information about the people responsible for the dataset. Select \u2018Add person\u2019, or \u2018Add organisational unit\u2019 if you want to add a whole organisation as a contributor. For each person you add you will be asked to provide their role and affiliation. Role Use \u2018Creator\u2019 to include that person\u2019s name in the citation for the dataset, use another role (for example Data Collector, Project Leader, Rights Holder) to acknowledge a person\u2019s contribution without including them in the citation You can add the same person multiple times if they had several roles. Affiliation on the dataset For each person provide their affiliation at the time that the dataset was created. This field should be automatically generated but you may need to update it if the person has since moved to a different department. Dataset managed by Check that the \u2018Managing organisational unit\u2019 is the department responsible for the dataset. Data availability This section collects information about where the data will be kept long term, and from where it will be available. Publisher This refers to where you will archive your dataset. If your data are deposited with an external repository, or you plan to do so, select \u2018Change publisher\u2019 and provide the repository name. Digital Object Identifier (DOI) if your dataset already has a DOI, include it here if your dataset does not have a DOI leave this section blank if you are depositing your data in Pure and it does not yet have a DOI, the Research Support Team will ensure a DOI is minted for your dataset after you have completed this form). Locally Held Data If you have non-digital or other local data that cannot be uploaded to Pure provide: a description of the data where that data will be kept how that data can be accessed the medium on which they are recorded (e.g. paper) Provide links to any secondary versions of the dataset, such as copies on a project website or another repository or links to closely related resources. Publication date If your dataset has already been published, give the date here. Otherwise, input the current year. Access contact details This is the main contact person for the dataset and must be one of the people listed as a \u2018Creator\u2019 in the \u2018People\u2019 section. If this is left blank we will assume that the first named \u2018Creator\u2019 of the project is the main contact. Temporal coverage If your dataset relates to period of time before you collected it (for example, animal records from 1850-1905), enter the date range here. Geographical location The information in this section enables your dataset to be found in searches for data about a particular area/place. Leave this section blank if your dataset contains information about vulnerable groups (for example, endangered species) or if location is not relevant. Geographical coverage Use this field to describe the location of data in words (e.g. Northampton, UK). Geospatial point and Area If it is appropriate and if the data were collected at a specific point, select \u2018Point\u2019 and enter the latitude and longitude separated by a comma, do the same for area. Legal/ethical In this section you must tell us about any data protection, ethical, commercial or sensitivity issues that relate to your dataset. If you are unsure email pure@northampton.ac.uk with the subject Datasets \u2013 Ethics for advice before saving your item for validation. (Save dataset as entry in progress until matter resolved). Data protection Tick this box if your dataset contains personal data unless the data has been fully anonymised. Provide details about whether you have gained consent from participants for data sharing, and if so under what terms (for example, data anonymisation or data sharing agreements). Ethical approval Tick this box if your research required ethical approval. Provide details on whether this affects your ability to share the data. Commercial constraints Tick this box if commercial considerations constrain your ability to share the data. In the text box that appears provide further details of these constraints (e.g. embargo time to allow commercialisation). If you have been working with a commercial partner, the constraints should be clear from the collaboration agreements. Consult with RIFS (Research Information & Funding Services) for more information. Sensitive Tick this box if your dataset contains material which may be considered to be sensitive for any reason not already covered (for example, locations of endangered species, fragile ecosystems, genetically-modified crops or animal testing units or data subject to non-disclosure agreements). Provide details of the nature of this sensitivity and the restrictions that should be put in place for the dataset or dataset record. Relations to other content Use the Project button to link your dataset to a project. We need to know this in order to tell who funded the work. You can also link your dataset to other outputs: - publications (articles, chapters) that make use of the data - related datasets (for example, from the same project or programme of work) Visibility This section determines whether the dataset will appear on your Research Profile. Set it to Campus to begin with. We will change it to Public for you later. If you have indicated in the Legal/ethical section that the dataset is so sensitive that even the record describing it cannot be made public change this setting to \u2018Confidential \u2013 restricted to associated users and editors\u2019. This will mean that the record will remain in Pure but will not be publicly accessible. Does data have to be Open Access? In most cases the default setting for deposited data is open access. However, there are circumstances where access to data can be restricted either permanently or for a limited embargo period. Common circumstances for restriction include: Data Protection Ethical approval Commercial constraints Sensitive content Moratorium on thesis data Period of exclusivity for data creators Pure offers a range of data visibility and access options to support your data and research requirements, email the Research Support Team at pure@northampton.ac.uk for further advice. External data deposit Research data produced at the University of Northampton should be deposited in PURE unless circumstances determine that a more appropriate repository is chosen, these include: The funder of the research mandate a specific data repository In joint research projects the data is deposited in the repository of a collaborator A specialist or disciplinary focused repository exists that provides data with greater impact Certain types of data, typically software or code, are better served in a version control repository such as GitHub. The only local requirement for external deposit is that a corresponding dataset record must be created in Pure which references and links to the external repository.

This expectation could be satisfied by converting and storing such data in digital format in a timely manner (minimum of 10 years, or 10 years from the date of last access). Appropriately structured metadata describing the research data is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet; in each case the metadata must be sufficient to allow others to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated, and how to access it. Where the research data referred to in the metadata is a digital object it is expected that the metadata will include use of a robust digital object identifier. Where access to the data is restricted the published metadata should also give the reason and summarise the conditions which must be satisfied for access to be granted. For example \u2018commercially confidential\u2019 data, in which a business organisation has a legitimate interest, might be made available to others subject to a suitable legally enforceable non-disclosure agreement. Research data is to be securely preserved for a minimum of 10 years from the date that any researcher \"privileged access\" period expires or, if others have accessed the data, from last date on which access to the data was requested by a third party; all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that publicly-funded data is not held in any jurisdiction where the available legal safeguards provide lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.","title":"Expectations for data management"},{"location":"datasets/#ethics-and-research-data-management","text":"","title":"Ethics and Research Data Management"},{"location":"datasets/#outline","text":"Most research data - even sensitive data - can be shared ethically and legally if researchers employ strategies of informed consent, anonymisation and controlling access to data.

SciVal is a research analytics and reporting tool using publication, citation and affiliation data from Scopus, including 38 million publication records from almost 22,000 journals of 5000 publishers worldwide. See our SciVal page for more information. Considerations when using bibliometrics Quality: high citation counts may not indicate quality. For example, an article may be cited frequently because other authors are refuting its findings. Disciplinary patterns: some research areas cite papers more than others. For example, in medicine and health there is a strong culture of citing and using other articles to validate findings.

Open Access is unrestricted access via the internet to peer reviewed scholarly research. Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, made available through the internet, including for those who do not have access to personal or institutional subscriptions to journals, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. This includes: Journal articles Conference proceedings Books & book chapters Monographs Research data Educational resources An advantage of OA over traditional publishing models is a higher impact and visibility of research, since that research reaches a wider audience. Research that is open access can therefore result in increased collaboration opportunities and citation impact. The following videos that explain this further: What is Open Access? Open Access Explained Open Access funding University of Northampton funding The University of Northampton has a small institutional fund for the payment of article processing charge. These must be agreed in advance of payment with the Head of Research Support, in addition the following conditions must be met: No suitable \"green\" route to open access (open access achieved through the accepted manuscript being deposited in Pure) Principle author must be staff member or post graduate student currently employed by the University of Northampton Article must be published under a CC-BY licence Accepted manuscript must be deposited in Pure Underlying dataset must be deposited in Pure Note \u2013 payment for monographs will also be considered Publishing \"gold\" allows the published version of your output to be made freely available immediately upon publication to anyone with internet access, rather than the accepted manuscript \u2013 which is often embargoed for a set time (generally between 6 \u2013 24 months). The University has entered into agreements that allow us discounts or for the cost to be part of our journal subscription cost for article processing charges: Springer (Most APC's zero cost \u2013 check with Research Support if in doubt Wylie (All APC's zero cost) SAGE (\u00a3200 Discount) Taylor and Francis (75% discount on most journals \u2013 must use NESLI voucher code) When publishing with any publisher, please contact openaccess@northampton.ac.uk and we can guide you through the copyright transfer process. Research funders Most research funders have a requirement for outputs that are published as a result of the funding, are made open access. Additionally many funders also require the underlying data to also be made available By accepting a research grant, the grant holder is responsible for meeting these requirements. If you do not comply with the funder's policy, the existing grant may be partially withheld, and you may not be eligible for future funding from this funder. Research Councils UK (RCUK) Horizon 2020 European Research Council (ERC) Charity Open Access Fund (COAF)/ Wellcome Trust Open Access and PhD theses It is a University requirement for all doctoral theses to be submitted electronically to the University's repository Pure. The full text of the thesis will then be made available open access via Pure and the British Library's EthOS repository. Open access is also a requirement of many funders. Making your thesis available open access has a number of advantages: Your thesis is directly discoverable by search engines, increasing the chance of citation and subsequent collaboration based upon the work Pure gives your thesis a stable URL, allowing you to monitor its impact by tracking citations and downloads, as well as protecting your work against plagiarism. In certain circumstances, for example where there are commercial or political sensitivities, students may embargo their thesis for an approved period. This should be discussed with your supervisor in the first instance. There has been concern in the past that open access to theses may be regarded as \"prior publication\" and prevent future development into a monograph. As a thesis would generally require significant revision before being published as a monograph, many publishers do not require the thesis to be embargoed. However, if you intend to develop your thesis into a monograph, you should contact potential publishers before making a decision about embargoes, as publisher policies vary considerably. You can carry out a quick check on what publishers do and don\u2019t allow in relation to publishing from your thesis.

Award management in Pure Pure Award Management is the University's award system which enables the Research and Innovation Funding Support team to track, monitor and manage bid-related activity. Integrated in Pure, the system allows academics and researchers to create applications for funding, obtain institutional approval and keep track of their applications. Pure Award Management also captures post award by the creation of awards and projects for successful bids. Academics and researchers can store post award documentation, record and track time spent on a project and create milestones. Research activities (datasets, equipment, impact, outputs and papers) can be linked to the project. Pure Award Management enables applications, awards and projects to be stored in one location making it an ideal one-stop source for your research.

The REF is a process of expert review , carried out by expert panels for each of the 34 subject based units of assessment (UOAs) , under the guidance of four main panels. Expert panels are made up of senior academics, international members, and research users . For each submission, three distinct elements are assessed: the quality of outputs (e.g. publications, performances, and exhibitions), their impact beyond academia, and the environment that supports research. In order for an Institution to submit to the REF, each Institution is required to write and have approved a code of practice that sets out their approaches to ensuring equality and transparency in REF 2021 decision-making processes, specifically in relation to: the determination of staff that have a significant responsibility for research & are independent researchers the process by which research outputs will be selected for inclusion in the REF, taking into account individual circumstances in a fair and transparent manner.
